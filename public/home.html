                    <p>Is he hall of famer. I would suspect most reading would say no. Let me make a case: the only Celtic/Laker champion.
                        
                        But think about what he's done in the playoff:
                        <!-- <li>1. The young true PG leading the the Celtics to the only championchip this century. 21 points, 8 assists, 7 rebounds in Game 6 </li>
                       <li> 2. One break (thank you Dwayne Wade for that desperate delibarte injurying) from getting past that Wade-Bosh-LeBron Heat team one year. (click to read more.)</li> -->
                    
                        <!-- <li>3."He outplayed James in the 2010 Eastern Conference semifinals and may well have been the Finals MVP that year had the Celtics emerged victorious. Rondo’s 44 points, 10 assists and eight rebounds in a Game 2 loss to James’ Heat in the 2012 conference finals is one of the great forgotten games in playoff history," qtd from Ben Rohrbach on Yahoo Sports.</li>
                      <li> 4. Then Teamed with LeBron and win a championchip with the Lakers. They do not win this championchip with out him.</li> -->
                       <!-- <li> * " He had the Bulls on the verge of a first-round upset of top-seeded Boston before suffering a series-ending thumb injury in 2017. </li>
                       <li> *.And he successfully steered the Pelicans to one of the most thorough first-round upsets in playoff history, a 2018 sweep of the Trail Blazers," (sorry, Rohrbach, I would have totally forgetten this if no for him, please check out his article). </li> -->
                       <!-- <p>As Bill Simmons said, "Dudley was talking about Rondo and said 'Him and lebron on a whole different level solving stuff.'"</p>
                       <p>As a longtime Rondo, guy I was so happy even thought I hat the lakes with every piece of my body, I was so happy that  he kind of had this moment. </p> -->

                      <!-- <p> "The Lakers do not win that championchip. He can go up to LeBron. He can go up to AD. Jackie MacMullin."</p> -->

                <p>Main Event: Match: C-, There were many good fights, so many that by the time the Korean Zombie got his desserts via Volonoski, the kid in front had fallen asleep for the fight he was looking most for too. It was 1:37, I think. I know it felt like it was 1:37. The crowd was a bit scary, but it wasn't quiet and got up for most the fights.</p>
